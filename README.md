1. Java Basics Practice

A collection of small programs to strengthen core programming skills:

Arraylist.java – Working with dynamic lists

AscendingDecending.java – Sorting logic

Classmethods.java – Understanding classes and methods

IFLoop.java – Looping and conditional statements

JavaBrushup.java – General practice exercises

sumofnumbers.java – Arithmetic and logic building

These exercises focus on logic development, flow control, and object-oriented concepts.

2. Selenium WebDriver Scripts

SeleniumIntro.java – Launching browser, navigating to pages

Locators.java – Practicing different element locators

test.java – A simple end-to-end automation example

These scripts demonstrate the basics of browser automation, locating web elements, sending input, and submitting forms.

3. Maven Project Setup

The project follows a simple Maven structure:

pom.xml manages all dependencies

Source code is placed under the standard src directory

This reflects how real-world automation and development projects are organized.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Java 17

Eclipse IDE

Selenium WebDriver

Maven

ChromeDriver (for browser automation)

▶️ How to Run the Scripts

Install JDK 17

Install Eclipse or any Java IDE
